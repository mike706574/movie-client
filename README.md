# movie-client

A single-page application for browsing a movie collection.

Uses [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame).

Deployed [here](https://mike-movies.herokuapp.com). Slow to load at first because of Heroku free idling - doubly-so because the server component is a separate Heroku app.
